## Overview

Lightbug is a simple and sweet HTTP framework for Mojo that builds on best practice from systems programming, such as the Golang [FastHTTP](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/) and Rust [may_minihttp](https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/may_minihttp/). 

This is not production ready yet. We're aiming to keep up with new developments in Mojo, but it might take some time to get to a point when this is safe to use in real-world applications.

Lightbug currently has the following features:
 - [x] Pure Mojo networking! No dependencies on Python by default
 - [x] TCP-based server and client implementation
 - [x] Assign your own custom handler to a route
 - [x] Craft HTTP requests and responses with built-in primitives
 - [x] Everything is fully typed, with no `def` functions used

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The only hard dependency for `lightbug_http` is Mojo. 
Learn how to get up and running with Mojo on the [Modular website](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo).
Once you have a Mojo project set up locally,

1. Add the `mojo-community` channel to your `mojoproject.toml`, e.g:
   ```toml
   [project]
   channels = ["conda-forge", "https://conda.modular.com/max", "https://repo.prefix.dev/mojo-community"]
   ```
2. Add `lightbug_http` as a dependency:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   lightbug_http = ">=0.1.3"
   ```
3. Run `magic install` at the root of your project, where `mojoproject.toml` is located
4. Lightbug should now be installed as a dependency. You can import all the default imports at once, e.g:
    ```mojo
    from lightbug_http import *
    ```
    or import individual structs and functions, e.g. 
    ```mojo
    from lightbug_http.http import HTTPService, HTTPRequest, HTTPResponse, OK, NotFound
    ```
    there are some default handlers you can play with:
    ```mojo
    from lightbug_http.service import Printer # prints request details to console
    from lightbug_http.service import Welcome # serves an HTML file with an image (currently requires manually adding files to static folder, details below)
    from lightbug_http.service import ExampleRouter # serves /, /first, /second, and /echo routes
    ```
5. Add your handler in `lightbug.🔥` by passing a struct that satisfies the following trait:
   ```mojo
   trait HTTPService:
    fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        ...
   ```
   For example, to make a `Printer` service that prints some details about the request to console:
   ```mojo
    from lightbug_http import *

    @value
    struct Printer(HTTPService):
        fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
            var uri = req.uri()
            print("Request URI: ", to_string(uri.request_uri()))
            
            var header = req.header
            print("Request protocol: ", header.protocol_str())
            print("Request method: ", to_string(header.method()))
            print("Request Content-Type: ", to_string(header.content_type()))

            var body = req.body_raw
            print("Request Body: ", to_string(body))

            return OK(body)
   ```
6. Start a server listening on a port with your service like so. 
    ```mojo
    fn main() raises:
        var server = SysServer()
        var handler = Printer()
        server.listen_and_serve("0.0.0.0:8080", handler)
    ```
Feel free to change the settings in `listen_and_serve()` to serve on a particular host and port.

Now send a request `0.0.0.0:8080`. You should see some details about the request printed out to the console.
   
Congrats 🥳 You're using Lightbug!


Routing is not in scope for this library, but you can easily set up routes yourself:
```mojo
from lightbug_http import *

@value
struct ExampleRouter(HTTPService):
    fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        var body = req.body_raw
        var uri = req.uri()

        if uri.path() == "/":
            print("I'm on the index path!")
        if uri.path() == "/first":
            print("I'm on /first!")
        elif uri.path() == "/second":
            print("I'm on /second!")
        elif uri.path() == "/echo":
            print(to_string(body))

        return OK(body)
```

We plan to add more advanced routing functionality in a future library called `lightbug_api`, see [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more details.

### Serving static files

The default welcome screen shows an example of how to serve files like images or HTML using Lightbug. Mojo has built-in `open`, `read` and `read_bytes` methods that you can use to read files and serve them on a route. Assuming you copy an html file and image from the Lightbug repo into a `static` directory at the root of your repo:

```mojo
from lightbug_http import *

@value
struct Welcome(HTTPService):
    fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        var uri = req.uri()

        if uri.path() == "/":
            var html: Bytes
            with open("static/lightbug_welcome.html", "r") as f:
                html = f.read_bytes()
            return OK(html, "text/html; charset=utf-8")
        
        if uri.path() == "/logo.png":
            var image: Bytes
            with open("static/logo.png", "r") as f:
                image = f.read_bytes()
            return OK(image, "image/png")
        
        return NotFound(uri.path())
```

### Using the client

Create a file, e.g `client.mojo` with the following code. Run `magic run mojo client.mojo` to execute the request to a given URL.

```mojo
from lightbug_http import *
from lightbug_http.sys.client import MojoClient

fn test_request(inout client: MojoClient) raises -> None:
    var uri = URI("http://httpbin.org/status/404")
    try:
        uri.parse()
    except e:
        print("error parsing uri: " + e.__str__())


    var request = HTTPRequest(uri)
    var response = client.do(request)

    # print status code
    print("Response:", response.header.status_code())

    # print parsed headers (only some are parsed for now)
    print("Content-Type:", to_string(response.header.content_type()))
    print("Content-Length", response.header.content_length())
    print("Server:", to_string(response.header.server()))

    print("Is connection set to connection-close? ", response.header.connection_close())

    # print body
    print(to_string(response.get_body_bytes()))


fn main() raises -> None:
    var client = MojoClient()
    test_request(client)
```

Pure Mojo-based client is available by default. This client is also used internally for testing the server.

## Switching between pure Mojo and Python implementations
By default, Lightbug uses the pure Mojo implementation for networking. To use Python's `socket` library instead, just import the `PythonServer` instead of the `SysServer` with the following line:
```mojo
from lightbug_http.python.server import PythonServer
```
You can then use all the regular server commands in the same way as with the default server.
Note: as of September, 2024, `PythonServer` and `PythonClient` throw a compilation error when starting. There's an open [issue](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/41) to fix this - contributions welcome!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

<div align="center">
    <img src="static/roadmap.png" alt="Logo" width="695" height="226">
</div>

We're working on support for the following (contributors welcome!):

-  [ ] [WebSocket Support](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/pull/57)
 - [ ] [SSL/HTTPS support](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/20)
 - [ ] UDP support
 - [ ] [Better error handling](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/3), [improved form/multipart and JSON support](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/4)
 - [ ] [Multiple simultaneous connections](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/5), [parallelization and performance optimizations](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/6)
 - [ ] [HTTP 2.0/3.0 support](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/8)
 - [ ] [ASGI spec conformance](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/17)

The plan is to get to a feature set similar to Python frameworks like [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette), but with better performance.

Our vision is to develop three libraries, with `lightbug_http` (this repo) as a starting point: 
 - `lightbug_http` - HTTP infrastructure and basic API development
 - `lightbug_api` - (coming later in 2024!) Tools to make great APIs fast, with support for OpenAPI spec and domain driven design
 - `lightbug_web` - (release date TBD) Full-stack web framework for Mojo, similar to NextJS or SvelteKit

The idea is to get to a point where the entire codebase of a simple modern web application can be written in Mojo. 

We don't make any promises, though -- this is just a vision, and whether we get there or not depends on many factors, including the support of the community.
